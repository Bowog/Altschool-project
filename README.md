URL Shortening: Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible, making it easy to share on social media or other channels.

QR Code Generation: Scissor allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. Users can download the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials or/and on their website. This feature will be implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be integrated into the Scissor platform.

Link History: Scissor allows users to see the history of links theyâ€™ve created so they can easily find and reuse links they have previously created

Delete Link: Allow user to delete generated link
